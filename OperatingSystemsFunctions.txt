The most important operating system function is it provides the Graphical User Interface. This allows the user to just click on a button rather than needing to type a command to complete a task. It is because there is a GUI that the computers are what they are. It allows everyone to interact with their computers the way they are use to.
Another imiportant operating system function is security. Computers are used to access, edit and complete various private information. The operating system has built in security features. A firewall is used to help keep unauthorized people, applications and other infectious software from accessing your computer.
The operating system also monitors performance. Many people have multiple applications open at once. The more applications open causes the computer hardware to work harder. The operating system can monitor multiple items at once and alert the user to a potential problem such as a low battery on a laptop. That way you can find a powersource or save your work and shut it down before you loose everything you have been working on.
